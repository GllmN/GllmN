# Hi there, I'm Guillaume NEAU, GllmN 👋

After working more than 10 years in the HVAC industry, I switched to fullstack developer in 2020👨💻.
- I started by discovering the HTML, CSS, PHP and JS languages by making my first projects, 👉 my website : https://guillaumeneau.com/ 
- 💻 I'm currently in Java backend developer (SpringBoot) with a project on web services.
- 🧪 Knowledge of **Javascript/Typescript, SQL(MySQL), NoSQL(Firebase), Linux and others**.
- 📚 And why not become a **fullstack NodeJs / Angular developer** on a project with microservices. 👀
- 💪🏼 Future goals : Learn more technologies : **NodeJS, Express, Sequelize, Docker, Nginx, MongoDB**,... 
- Never stop creating new ideas, because I love solving problems through IT.
